Advent Day 8
Antennas scattered across the grid, each whispering secrets to the void.

Part 1 pulled me in: mapping signals and deciphering their patterns felt like tuning into an ancient frequency. The grid came alive as I traced paths, seeking the elusive "antinodes"—points of connection in a chaotic world. Every misstep was just a recalibration, every success, a moment of clarity.

Part 2 asked more: not just identifying connections, but understanding their reach. Each antenna had a story, a ripple effect beyond its immediate surroundings. I followed those trails, sometimes into infinity, until the boundaries of the grid stopped me.

There's something beautiful about finding order in the noise—a satisfying rhythm in the challenge of decoding relationships.
